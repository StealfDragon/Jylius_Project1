Metal-Blooded
Gothic Sci-Fi Sidescroller with (hopefully) flashy combat and long levels that culminate in new and unique boss fights.

Story: Your horse gets stolen by the cyberpunk mafia of the future! You are arrested and must break out, and then go on an adventure to reclaim your horse. You must fight your way through swaths of enemies in varied gothic-cyberpunk levels in order to be reunited with your companion.
